# KernelLearningSOS
To start, take a look at the LogisticExperiments jupyter notebook. Here we run the experiments for the logistic map and store all results. In the analysis notebook we then produce the results from these experiments which are stored in the Results directory.

The figures in the experiment notebooks are not used in the paper, only the ones generated by the Analysis notebook.
